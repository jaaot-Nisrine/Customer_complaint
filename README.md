# Customer_complaint
PFE_2016
The customer complaints management is an essential part in the quality management system for the company to remove any ambiguity 
about the claims management process for the renewal of the certification,the company must have a computerized platform of claims management.
My work entitled "The implementation of an application for managing customer complaints for Al Omrane Meknes" is part of this perspective, 
and just to address the deficiencies identified in the statement of the problem.
The result of this work is to guarantee Alomrane Meknes effective and operative management for customer complaints.
Through this work we can:
*As a user I can sing in using a username and a password;
*As a user I can {display, add, modify, delete} each item of: Agency , product, issues of the complaint, client, complaint , claim processing.
*Using the JpGraph library, the user can view graphs related to issues of the complaint (Pie chart) and the calim processing (histograms).
*As a user I can be : project manager, sales representative, after-sales responsible and the admin. 

Limits of the code :
* The option "print" does not work because the file "imprimerBC.php" is not well configured.
* In the file "statistique.php" I had some issues while displaying the pie chart and also some special characters such as "Ã©".
* As a user I can add or delete another user whether is it project manager, sales representative, after-sales responsible or the admin.
Note: 
*I didn't write the entire code but the parts with PHP code.
